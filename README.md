C/Vulkan/Gamedev are kind of my fields of interest. [Vulkan2D](http://www.github.com/PaoloMazzon/Vulkan2D) is my main project which is a small 2D rendering library using Vulkan as a backend. I used it to create [Spacelink](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/Spacelink) for Ludum Dare 47 which was a great deal of fun. I just recently created [JamUtil](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/JamUtil) for it as well that provides some useful tools to create jam games with VK2D. Also [JamEngine](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/JamEngine) is as of right now not being worked on despite still being a decent usable engine with some good bells and whistles.
