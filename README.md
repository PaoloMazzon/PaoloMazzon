C/Vulkan/gamedev are my primary fields of interest. [Vulkan2D](http://www.github.com/PaoloMazzon/Vulkan2D) is my main "project" which is a small 2D rendering library using Vulkan as a backend (I also made [JamUtil](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/JamUtil) which is a small set of tools to use with VK2D to make game jams easier). I used it to create [Spacelink](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/Spacelink) and [Peace & Liberty](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/PeacenLiberty) for Ludum Dare [47](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/spacelink) and [48](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/peace-liberty) respectively. At the moment I am also working on a game framework/engine called [Astro Engine](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/astro-engine) which is a project that combines the aforementioned [Vulkan2D](http://www.github.com/PaoloMazzon/Vulkan2D) and [JamUtil](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/JamUtil) (as well as a whole bunch of other tools built for it specifically) into one easy-to-use [Wren](https://github.com/wren-lang/wren) VM.
