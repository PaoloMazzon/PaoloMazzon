C/Vulkan/gamedev are my primary fields of interest. [Vulkan2D](http://www.github.com/PaoloMazzon/Vulkan2D) is my main "project" which is a small 2D rendering library using Vulkan as a backend (I also made [JamUtil](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/JamUtil) which is a small set of tools to use with VK2D to make game jams easier). I used it to create [Spacelink](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/Spacelink) and [Peace & Liberty](https://github.com/PaoloMazzon/PeacenLiberty) for Ludum Dare [47](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/spacelink) and [48](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/peace-liberty) respectively.
